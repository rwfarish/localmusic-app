## About The Project

CHS Live aims to further the Charleston music community experience by bringing together performers, venues, and fans. After noticing a void in the Charleston music press, an initiative has been made to provide a digital solution for the Charleston music community.  

* :speaker: Venues - can advertise their music schedule, while engaging with local musicians and music lovers
* :microphone: Performers - can promote their shows and find venues to network with
* :headphones: Local, and visiting, music fans - can keep up to date with the rich local music culture here in Charleston
